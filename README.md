About me:
I currently Work in a Helpdesk position with a Company called Rmon Networks we are a MSP and work 90% remote. I’ve been with the company about 5 months now and it has really opened my eyes to how much in terms of knowledge and experience i was lacking. It has been a humbling and amazing experience with it being a smaller company no two days are the same. I’m currently in Linux Admin at Northern Essex Community College.
