# Linux-Admin-Portfolio

About me:
I currently Work in a Helpdesk position with a Company called Rmon Networks we are a MSP and work 90% remote. I’ve been with the company about 5 months now and it has really opened my eyes to how much in terms of knowledge and experience i was lacking. It has been a humbling and amazing experience with it being a smaller company no two days are the same. I’m currently in Linux Admin at Northern Essex Community College.

Interests: I have astrong intrests to learn more on scripting and networking as i have learned on peronsal experience networking is vital to most buisnesses and even down to day top day general computer use. I also wish to increase my knowledge of hardware (routers, firewalls, and exstanders) as well as software that go with these devices like dns, sophos, umbrella, and many more)
